<details><summary>INTRODUCTION</summary>
<p>

More than one million Europens suffer from stroke every year. Around two-thirds of the survivors are having a upper limb paresis. 
The number is still rising, so in the next years there is even a greater need of rehabilitation. A few people are able to recover completely from UL paresis after six month. For now people are getting conventional therapy and in advance self- and tele-rehabilitation. With the actual technical developement in robot assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) therapists get assistance. Recent meta-analysis suggest a superior effect of these new interventions. Authors have stated that the VR is specifically developed for this and are fulfilling numerous neurorehabilitation principles. These playful interventions are called serious games. 
A serious game is by definition a game that is fulfilling educational or rehabitational goals. In the case of stroke rehabilitation these games are designed for that reason and have several motor relearning principles
These games are developed to stimulate recovery and maintain the motivation of the patients.
