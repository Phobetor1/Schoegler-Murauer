Serious Games are finding their way into the rehabilitions more and more. Easy to use and supportive for the health care workers. 
The meta-analysis "Serious Games for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke" by Doumas, Everard, Dehem & Lejeune (2021) 
investigated the impact of serious games on upper limb rehabilitation after suffering from a stroke. 


##  META-ANALYSIS OVERVIEW

**Focus** 

Effect of Serious Games on UL rehabilitation after stroke

**Effect Size**

moderate effect on UL motor function

**Target Group**

physio therapists, stroke patients and relatives

<details><summary>INTRODUCTION</summary>
<p>

More than one million Europens suffer from stroke every year. Around two-thirds of the survivors are having a upper limb paresis. 
The number is still rising, so in the next years there is even a greater need of rehabilitation. 
A few people are able to recover completely from UL paresis after six month. 
For now people are getting conventional therapy and in advance self- and tele-rehabilitation. 
With the actual technical developement in robot assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) therapists get assistance. 
Recent meta-analysis suggest a superior effect of these new interventions. 
Authors have stated that the VR is specifically developed for this and are fulfilling numerous neurorehabilitation principles. 
These playful interventions are called serious games. 
A serious game is by definition a game that is fulfilling educational or rehabitational goals. 
In the case of stroke rehabilitation these games are designed for that reason and have several motor relearning principles
These games are developed to stimulate recovery and maintain the motivation of the patients.

<details><summary>TOPIC</summary>
<p>

Previous work on the efficacy of VR-based interventions were showing that serious games could have a positive impact on the patient.
Recent theoretical research proposed consolidation of commonly acknowledged neurorehabilitation principles in serious games.
The question is if the specific principles are correlating with the efficacy. 
So the authors decided to address this meta-analysis to this purpose and were following the PICOS form: in adults after stroke (P), 
do serious games, implemented on various technological systems (I), show better efficacy than conventional treatment (C), 
to rehabilitate UL function and activity, and patient's participation (O).
So they were searching for relevant literature. They were looking for ten criterias to measure. 
 For example: amount of practice, task-specific practice, feedback and so on.

<details><summary>RESULTS</summary>
<p>

Rehabilitation using serious games led to significantly better improvements compared to conventional treatments.
They highlighted that studies that were fulfilling eight or more neurorehabilitation principles had significant results.
Serious games were effective in improving UL mototr function in both subacute and chronic stage after stroke, 
 but no difference between these groups.
An improvement in the rehabilitation was measured also for all components of the ICF-WHO.

<details><summary>CONCLUSION FOR THERAPY</summary>
<p>

The meta-analysis is showing that there is a significant effect for UL motor function, 
 UL activity and participation after stroke with serious games.
The device for the serious game is not important. The crucial part is the neurorehabilitaion principles. 
 If there are more than eight involved it is showing an effect.
So overall it make sense to use serious games for rehabilitation after a stroke. Important are that the interventions are fitting the criteria.For 
the near future it would make sense to do it additionally to the conventional therapy, because it would save ressources from the therapists and 
 more people could have a chance to get the best treatment for themselves.

 **study 1**
VIRTUAL REALITY BASE REHABILITATION SPEEDS UP FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY OF THE UPPER EXTREMITIES AFTER STROKE
 
 This study used a VR-based rehabilitation for the upper limb system in the acute phase after a stroke. 
 The Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) was their main tool. As we already know from the meta-analysis the needs for stroke rehabilitation
 is rising, so self-managed rehabilitation approaches are in need. The patients got a 12 week treatment and in addition conventional therapy. 
 The control group was having a time matched alternative treatment, like occupational therapy and non-specific interactive games.
 The basic idea was to show the participants a virtual upper limb to stimulate them.
 The theory behind that is based on the human mirror neuron system, a system that is active during execution and oberserving other 
 people while executing. They where using the Rehabilitation Gaming System, which is simulating the movement and 
 action of the patients upper body on a screen. The patients got equipped with data gloves that were connected to the device to measure the
 movement of hands and fingers. They used a dynamic system for the difficulty of the tasks. The goal was to keep the participants around
 70% correct trials to prevent boredom and frustration. The users were playing a game called Spheroids, where the had to interract with 
 upcoming spheres and perform basic arm movements, like grasping, object displacement and release.
 The speed of the paretic arm was measured and the authors found that the patients using the RGS were significantly faster.
 At the end of the treatment the participants got tested with two test for arm movement and hand and arm activity.
